# My WKP5-A explanation

## 1- succeeded work in this project
-  Creating a renderCard function that loop through each object.
-  Generating a card in html.
-  Displaying the HTML in a list.
-  Placing the id of the recipe as a data-attribute to get the full recipe.
-  showing the modal of the full recipe

## 2- Project requirement
There are still more part to go in this project, which means I could not manage to finish the requirement until the end.

## 3- Additonal enhancement and improvement

### Additionnal enhancement
- If I still had more time:
    - firstly, I would go further to start to work on the next part, which is putting the form that we had with the last project into this new one.
    - secondly, I would prefer to put more comments to my work or may be I should have tried on new things.
    - And the last would be getting creative with the project and putting good styles on it.

### Areas of improvement
- I had faced some difficulty to make the modal works.
- I ran out of times because of finding a bug in the first part.

## 4- Error
There is no console error so far.
